    "- Where possible use domain specific knowledge to use variables that you believe should effect the target variable\n",

For example if it was found that smoking increased risk of cancer, and also that lack of exercise increased risk of cancer, however a combination of both subtationaly increased your risk of cancer you may wish to included an input variable that is the product of both of these. This is more appropiate in predictive regression as opposed to explanatory regression \n",

This is not a binary issue and most models will have it to some degree. Wehn variables are highly correlated it becomes hard to correctly estimate the contribution of each variable to the target variable. "

    "The coefficients indidcate that team size has the biggest effect on medal count, even given the scales that GDP and population are measured in. Using this type of analysis is useful for gaining both an insight into the factors that effect medal count at the games, but it also allows us to make predictions. However if we just wanted to predict the future medal count of an olympic games we also have access to the medal count from that team at the games prior to the one we are trying to predict. It is suspected that this factor alone will be a strong predictor however when combined with the other factors we have investigated it is likely to give an even better medal count prediction Therefore lets introduce previous games medal count for each team to give improved predicitve power.
